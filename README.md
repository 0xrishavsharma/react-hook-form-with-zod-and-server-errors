If you want to be a professional developer, you have to know the fundamentals like JavaScript and CSS really well. I highly recommend you go through my [Professional JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-javascript-course/?referralCode=0C1D5752923168BC87C2) and [Professional CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-css/?referralCode=4C3C08E82629E6B15752) courses.

I'm close to releasing a complete React & Next.js course. Get on the email list to receive early-bird pricing: [link](https://email.bytegrad.com/).
